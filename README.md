#Lab 0- ENGO 551- Alex Torres
This website was inspired by my fellow international friends and myself that came to Canada to study.

My idea was to create a fully responsive website of a company that advice and help international students to study and live in Canada.

I used 'link' to connect to my css file, to obtain different fonts, and to add icons.

@media query was used several times to adjust the screen to a phone size screen. Some adjustment includes font-size, box-size, and image-size.

##index
The home-page is the most completed one out of the 5 html files I created.

You can access to any of the options of the hyperlinked menu on the top right.

I added a bootstrap to make responsive buttons 'hero-btn' and added a trasnparent background, a 'hover' selector was added to create a transition effect and to change the color to red when courser is selected.

Several 'div class'es were made to add boxes and sections.

For the testimonial the footer section we added icons from fontaweome.com and 'i' such as review stars and social media logos.

Several png and jpg images were included in the website through 'img src'

A java script toggle was created to be able to hide and open the menu when in phone mode.

###cities
This sub-section has a different backgroun than the home site. It contains a table with different cities that I would recommmend to students for living.

It also connects to the other option of the menu, and includes information to contact the company.

###connect
This sub-section contains a big picture, and information to communicate with the company. I included a responsive button that takes you to more information.

###Universities and colleges
In this sub-section I added a referenced list of Universities and colleges for students planning their post-secondary studies in Canada.

##Immigration
In this subsection I added a big picture with information regarding immigration and a responsive button that takes you to more information.
